Changelog for Revision 0.2:

* stubs.c (istrstr): return -1 on failure, rather than NULL; this
matches expected usage at call sites.

* stubs.c (r_strncpy,r_memcpy): guard array access dest[n-1]

* stubs.c: correct compilation errors on GCC
(strcpy,strlen): make type qualifiers consistent with stubs.h
(r_memcpy,memcpy): make two versions, one which does no typecasting
but dereferences void pointers, and one which typecasts void pointers
to unsigned char pointers; control with TYPECAST_MEMCPY in stubs.h

* MADWiFi/CVE-2006-6332/constants.h: change BUFSZ so that bufsize > 2
  check succeeds

* MADWiFi/CVE-2006-6332/encode_ie/*ok.c: use corrected patch from
MadWiFi project

* bind/CA-1999-14/rrextract-nxt/*.c: ensure that n >= dlen so that n2
cannot be negative

* bind/CA-1999-14/rrextract-nxt/*.c: consistently use SPACE_FOR_VARS,
and ensure that SPACE_FOR_VARS is big enough to allow the program to
chomp through all variables it reads from the input without aborting
early

* bind/CVE-2001-0011/nslookupComplain/*.c: conflate two calls to
strcpy/strncpy, since they're exactly the same, and one is currently
unreachable

* SpamAssassin/BID-6679/constants.h: increase BUFSZ to ensure that
limit >= 0

* NetBSD-libc/CVE-2006-6652/glob3/glob3_*.c: remove extraneous things to check
glob3_ptr_{bad,ok}.c: remove /* BAD */ and /* OK */ comments from
dereferences of pathend, which doesn't change
glob3_ptr_{bad,ok}.c: change two accesses pathend[i] to pathend[0] in
order to match semantics of original sources, and remove /* BAD */ and
/* OK */ comments as with the ptr versions

* NetBSD-libc/CVE-2006-6652/glob3/*.c: Fix broken loops which caused
  overflows in OK testcases

* OpenSER/CVE-2006-6876/constants.h: Increase PDUSIZE by 2 to account
  for two '\r' characters so that call to r_strcpy is reachable

* sendmail/CVE-2003-0681/buildfname: Completely new breakdown of the testcases.
