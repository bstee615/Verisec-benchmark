TOM: SOMETHING I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS GOING ON HERE -- WHILE TRYING TO
MAKE THE OK VERSION, I SAW THAT THE LINE MARKED AS BAD IN ZITSER'S
WHICH I CONSIDERED THE IMPORTANT OVERFLOW WASN'T CHANGED. I'LL HAVE TO
REDO THIS ONE. FOR NOW, WE CAN'T USE IT IN THIS PAPER.

I'VE RENAMED THE TESTCASE TO NOT END IN BAD SO THAT WE DON'T
ACCIDENTALLY COUNT IT.

_ Vulnerable Functions and Buffers _

An initial overflow in mapping_chdir() overflows global buffers
pathspace and mapped_path. This overflow is trivial.

Since overflows that depend on overflows are outside our scope, we
don't consider these subsequent errors. This entry is thus pretty
trivial.
