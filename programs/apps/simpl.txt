Simplifications applied to testcases (duplicate simplifications are omitted); includes simplifications applied to already simplified testcases, not just the "base" case.

Generic simplifications
=======================

(LANG) Eliminate register, enum, static; replace a = b >=c with if (b >= c) a = 1; else a = 0; (sometimes) rewrite for loops as while or do/while

(PTR_ARR) Replace pointer ops with array ops

(INLINE) Merge body of called function into caller

sendmail
========

Note: the sendmail simplifications were initially applied to Zitser's model programs, not the original source.

CVE-1999-0047
-------------

(PACKAGE)
  Remove header, envelope structs; replace envelope, which contains input, by a char[]
  Remove header field extraction
  Remove test of header field

(NUM_INPUT) In loop which iterates over string input, reduce number of input characters which are read, tested, and copied to dest buffer per iteration (initially three)

(FGET) Replace fgetc by nondet stub

(INPUT_DEP) Simplify/remove branches on input value

(CONV) Remove input char conversion (by table lookup)

(BIT) Remove bitmasking of input

(COND) Simplify branch conditions (factored out ||-disjuncts)


CVE-1999-0206
-------------

PACKAGE CONV BIT BRANCH PTR_ARR

(CONST_PROP) Remove "state" variable (which is always 0 in Zitser)
  Removed branch on state

FGET Remove loop over fgets

(DEREF) Replaced char** by char*


CVE-2001-0653
-------------

BRANCH NUM_INPUT

Remove switch on getopt (vulnerable function only called for specific cmdline arg)

(INPUT_LOOP) Remove loop over input (so first input substring has to produce overflow)

Simplify multiple-side-effect statement

Remove code which computes value to write into dest buf


CVE-2002-0906
-------------

CONST_PROP PACKAGE INPUT_LOOP

FGET Remove reading input from file (replaced with uninitialized char[])

Remove testing of input length which guards call to vuln function

(USELESS) Remove useless extraction of values from input

Remove switch cases which don't contain a vulnerability (and which are unreachable in Zitser since input is rigged)


CVE-2002-1337
-------------

FGET Replace scanf with uninit char[]

INPUT_DEP
  Remove skipping over leading spaces
  Remove handling backslashed, quoted, parenthesized, bracketed substrings
  Remove checking for input that "must be quoted"

STATE
  Remove a lot of context-sensitive testing, counting, and copying of input
  Remove handling of context variables which track, e.g., bracket nesting depth


CVE-2003-0161
-------------

CONST_PROP PACKAGE INPUT_LOOP

INPUT_DEP Remove an embedded FSM which is driven by (table lookup of) input chars


CVE-2003-0681
-------------

PACKAGE

(SLICE) Remove all useless code in calling context of vulnerable function
  -- Zitser seems to have retained a lot of useless code in this one for some reason

FGET Replace lookup of passwd information with uninit char[]

INPUT_DEP Remove code which computes length of expanded input (subsequent code just blindly copies the expanded input into dest anyway)

CONV Remove code which uppercases input after copying it
